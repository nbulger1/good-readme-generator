  ## Description
  
  This application was created because pets require a semi-consistent feeding schedule, but often times their owners have busy schedules, so having such a way to keep track of feeding would be useful. Through application development, I learned that there are several different phases of feeding a dog that depends on age, activity level, size, etc.

  ## Usage
          
  Instructions for use:
  
  Load the browser window and within the input or drop down boxes enter your dog’s name, weight, activity level, type of food (wet or dry). Once entered then a general schedule will appear, from there adjust your specific wake up and bedtimes so the times can readjust according to your specific schedule. Each week download the schedule so you can post it in your house and check off as the dog is fed. 
  
  Examples:
  - to organize schedules
  - check that your dog is fed
  - adjust feeding schedules based on activity level
